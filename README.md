# Yu-CrossHermit
Cross Hermit is an SRPG by Kogado Studio
This is a Japanese & Chinese only game.

For the purposes of this project, I will be using the Chinese Version as that is the copy of the game I've own since the young days.
Personally had this game in my collection for over 18 years now. As its 20th Anniversary approaches, I thought, there is no better way then for me to give this game a modern fresh coat of paint and try to make it accessible for the western audience. As really it is a fun SRPG to play. There is little information about this game in the english community, So ill drive to change that.

Game uses a scipt file for each battle, and each menu there is, which there is 54 total for battles and menu's. Below you will see those listed out based off there name and there status of translation work done. Game playfields also uses a bmp image set to the backlayer of the game, so those are easy to upscale and implement. 

Acquired the originial Japanese version thanks to @jet082, Ill test my changes on this version to ensure it still works great, then notate any changes between the two games. 
Going forward ill be using the Japanese version for all things, as it will be much easier to acquire this version of the game. There are no changes from what i see between the actually games, besides text and font changes.

**The Goals**
- No CD Check the exe (game uses securom)
- Fixes Resolution and Forced Fullscreen mode
- Ensure the game runs smoothly on Win10 and new hardware
- Scale up Textures 
- Translate the important stuff to enjoy the game (This has turned into a near full translation project)
- Reimport modified Assest for translation purposes (this game uses alot of image text)
- Enable Debug Mode (if possible)
- Everything else is extra 

**Completed Work**
- First version of Text Insertion Tools are done.
- No CD Check 
- Window Mode and all 4:3 Resolutions (unlikely ill be able to patch in 16:9)
- Working great on Win10 now
- All Assets are Extracted
- Image Extraction and Insertion is completed and working!
- Script is extracted, Test injections prove the game font will be fine. Game is starting translation phase, with the insertion tools I've created.
