# Yu-CrossHermit
Cross Hermit is an SRPG by Kogado Studio
This is a Japanese & Chinese only game.

For the purposes of this project, I will be using the Chinese Version as that is the copy of the game I've own since the young days.
Personally had this game in my collection for over 18 years now. As its 20th Anniversary approaches, I thought, there is no better way then for me to give this game a modern fresh coat of paint and try to make it accessible for the western audience. As really it is a fun SRPG to play. There is little information about this game in the english community, So ill drive to change that.

Acquired the originial Japanese version thanks to @jet082, Ill test my changes on this version to ensure it still works great, then notate any changes between the two games. 

**The Goals**
- No CD Check the exe (game uses securom)
- Fixes Resolution and Force Fullscreen mode
- Ensure the game runs smoothly on Win10 and new hardware
- Scale up Textures 
- Translate the important stuff to enjoy the game
- Reimport modified Assest for translation purposes (this game uses alot of image text)
- Enable Debug Mode (if possible)
- Everything else is extra 

**Completed Work**
- No CD Check 
- Window Mode and all 4:3 Resolutions (unlikely ill be able to patch in 16:9)
- Working great on Win10 now
- All Assets are Extracted
