# Yu-CrossHermit
Cross Hermit is an SRPG by Kogado Studio,
This is a Japanese & Chinese only game,

For the purposes of this project, I will be using the Chinese Version as that is the copy of the game I've own since the young days.
Personally had this game in my collection for over 18 years now. As its 20th Anniversary approaches, I thought, there is no better way then for me to give this game a modern fresh paint of coat and try to make it accessible for the western audience. As really it is a fun SRPG to play. There is little information about this game in the english community, So ill drive to change that.

The Goals are
- No CD Check the exe
- Ensure the game runs smoothly on Win10 and new hardware
- Translate the important stuff to enjoy the game
- Everything else is extra
